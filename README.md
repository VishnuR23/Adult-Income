# Income Prediction Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores a **Kaggle dataset** to analyze and predict factors that influence **income levels**. The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning modeling**.  

The goal is to identify which features are most strongly correlated with income and to build a predictive model that highlights these relationships.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Source: **Kaggle dataset** (provide link if available).  
- The dataset contains demographic and socioeconomic attributes related to individuals.  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed missing and inconsistent values.  
- Standardized categorical and numerical features.  
- Prepared the dataset for exploratory and predictive analysis.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Conducted **in-depth exploration** of dataset structure and distributions.  
- Applied **data visualization methodologies** (histograms, box plots, bar charts, etc.) to uncover trends and patterns across demographic groups.  

### 4. Feature Analysis  
- Used **correlation matrices** to measure relationships between variables.  
- Identified the most impactful features influencing **income levels**.  

### 5. Machine Learning Modeling  
- Implemented **Random Forest classifiers/regressors** to evaluate feature importance.  
- Compared performance against baseline models.  
- Interpreted model outputs to highlight which features best predict income.
